# CTF Exploits

This is a collection of exploit templates that can be helpful when attacking common vulnerabilities.

## Exploits

 - **dump**: A simple express app for dumping information from a remote host.
 - **php_magic**: A script that generates _magic numbers_ for exploiting [PHP Type Juggling](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php) vulnerabilities.
 - **pwntools**: A template for quickly prototyping exploits using the [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools#readme) library.
 - **rsa_crack**: A quick and dirty [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) cracker from [asecuritysite.com](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/rsa12_2).

## Setup

### Quick Setup

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Setup

```
pip3 install pwntools
pip3 install pycryptodome
pip3 install libnum
```

## Usage

You can use any of these exploits in-place, but it is recommended that you use this repository as more of a collection of templates. You should copy the exploit you would like to use into your CTF challenge directory. From there you can edit and update the copy as much as you want and still have the original to use for the next challenge!

### Example for pwntools

```
mkdir -p ctf/challenge
cd ctf/challenge
cp ../../ctf-tools/exploits/pwntools.py ./exploit.py

vim ./exploit.py  # Write your exploit
./exploit.py      # Run your exploit
```
